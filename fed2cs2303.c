/** Function to read a line from the US FED and return pointer to the 
 * line of data represented as a C-String (i.e. NULL terminated string)
 *
 * @lineptr is a pointer to the dynamically allocated buffer to fill.
 *   If the pointer is NULL, a buffer will be allocated to hold the line.
 *   If the buffer is too small to hold the line, realloc will be called
 *   to allocate a larger buffer. If the buffer is reallocated, n will
 *   be set to new size.
 * @n is a pointer to the size of the buffer pointer to be lineptr. If
 *   memory is reallocated for lineptr, the size of n will be incremented
 *   accordingly. The parameter n will always specify the size of buffer
 *   pointed at by lineptr.
 * @fptr is the FILE pointer to the open file to read.
 * @return number bytes (chars) read or -1 on error

/** main function to drive program. Input and output file names specified

 * usage:
 *    fed2cs2301 input_file output_file
 *
 * The input file must already exist. Output file will be created.
 *
 * Approach:
 * 1) Open both input and output files, or fail with error
 * 2) Read a line from input. This is a record of federal zip code data
 *    Note: the first line of the file is header info, not data, ignore it
 * 3) Parse the input line to populate a ZIP_FEDERAL structure
 * 4) Write the ZIP_FEDERAL structure to output file 1 record / line
 *    Note: no column header information will be written out, just  data fields
 * 5) Close output and input files and exit cleanly
 *
 * @param argc is the number of input strings - will be 3
 * @param argv is array of cmd line args -
 *        fed2cs2301 existing_input_file output_file_to_create
 * @return 0 for success. non-zero for error
